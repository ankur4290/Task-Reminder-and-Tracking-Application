Task Reminder and Tracking Application
Project Overview

This project is a Java-based Task Reminder and Tracking Application developed using Core Java concepts and Spring Boot RESTful APIs.
It allows users to create and manage tasks, schedule reminders, track task completion, generate task overviews, and export reports in CSV format.

The application is designed to demonstrate timers, collections, concurrency, JDBC-based persistence, and RESTful API design, without relying on heavy frameworks beyond Spring Boot, as required by the assessment.

Project Objectives

Provide reliable task scheduling and timely reminders

Track completed and pending tasks accurately

Generate task overviews and exportable CSV reports

Expose secure and testable RESTful APIs

Demonstrate core Java concepts (collections, concurrency, JDBC)

Modules Implemented
Module 1: Task Organization Engine

Manages task creation, updates, listing, and persistence.

Features

Add, fetch, update, and complete tasks

JDBC-based database interaction using H2

Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)

APIs

POST /tasks – Create a new task

GET /tasks – Retrieve all tasks

PUT /completion/mark/{id} – Mark a task as completed

Concepts Used

Java Collections

JDBC (JdbcTemplate)

RESTful API design

Exception handling

Module 2: Scheduling System

Handles reminder scheduling and lifecycle tracking.

Features

Reminder scheduling using ScheduledExecutorService

Concurrent reminder tracking using thread-safe collections

Reminder lifecycle status (pending / triggered)

APIs

POST /schedule/set – Schedule a reminder for a task

GET /schedule/reminders/{taskId} – Retrieve reminder status

Concepts Used

Java Concurrency

Timers and scheduling

Thread-safe collections (ConcurrentHashMap)

Module 3: Overview & CSV Integration Hub

Provides reporting, CSV exports, and email reminder integration.

Features

Task overview (total, completed, pending)

CSV export of task data

Email reminder integration using JavaMail API (mocked)

APIs

GET /reports/overview – Retrieve task summary

POST /reports/export – Export tasks as a CSV report

CSV Details

Timestamp-based file naming

Safe handling of null values

Proper CSV formatting with quoted text fields

Email Notes

JavaMail API is integrated

Email sending is mocked (printed to console) for security reasons

This approach reflects common development and testing practices

Module 4: Completion Tracker

Provides task completion insights and status analytics.

Features

Track completion status of individual tasks

Structured task status response

APIs

GET /completion/status/{taskId} – Retrieve task status

Status Response Includes

Task ID

Completion flag

Status (PENDING / COMPLETED)

Due date

Technology Stack

Java 21

Spring Boot

JDBC (JdbcTemplate)

H2 In-Memory Database

Maven

Postman (API testing)

Database Configuration

H2 in-memory database

Automatically initialized on application startup

H2 Console available at:

http://localhost:8081/h2-console

How to Run the Application
Prerequisites

Java 21

Maven

Steps
mvn spring-boot:run


Application will start on:

http://localhost:8081

Testing

All APIs were tested using Postman, including:

Task creation and updates

Reminder scheduling and status tracking

CSV export generation

Completion status insights

GitHub Commit Strategy

Each major module was implemented, tested, and pushed separately

Commit messages clearly map to assessment modules

Maintains a clean and review-friendly commit history

Notes for Evaluators

Email reminders are mocked to prevent credential exposure

Core Java concepts (collections, concurrency, JDBC) are explicitly demonstrated

Application follows a clean, modular, and assessment-aligned design
